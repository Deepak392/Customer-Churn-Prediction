Internship Project

Why are we doing this analysis?
In our 2023 YoY Financial review, we saw ~$1M ARR loss on Webapp for 2023, which sparked
the curiosity to understand churn in-depth. This led to our Phase 1 analysis, which focused
solely on the Churned Accounts, their ARR impact, and resp. data cut.
With the Phase 2 in-depth analysis covering both Retained and Churned accounts on
Webapp, we are targeting drawing patterns basis various cuts on their resp. product usage
behaviours, churn patterns and user personas. The aim is to look for early indicators of churn
and come up with potential ways to counter them and retain accounts better.
